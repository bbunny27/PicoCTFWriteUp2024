<h1>PicoCTF Write-up! <><> WORK IN PROGRESS <><></h1>
<p>My team the Cyberhawks competed in the PicoCTF 2024 competition! We finished 2169th place out of 6947 teams in the open category, as we had one member of our team who was not a college student. I will update this when I have time.</p>
<h4>Super SSH (General Skills)</h4>
<p>Super SSH is the first and lowest point challenge in Pico CTF as a whole. The goal is to connect with a server through SSH.</p>
